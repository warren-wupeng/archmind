# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**ArchMind/Architecta** is an AI-powered Architecture Agent system designed to serve as a 24/7 Chief AI Architect. This repository currently contains only planning and specification documents for the product.

### Current State
- **Development Phase**: Pre-development/Planning
- **Content**: Business plan and product specification (Chinese language)
- **Files**: Single `readme.md` file (14.2KB) containing comprehensive product specification

### Product Vision
The planned system will convert business strategy questions into executable technical solutions through intelligent multi-agent orchestration, targeting C-level executives, business unit leaders, and non-technical founders.

## Repository Structure

```
archmind/
└── readme.md    # Complete business plan and product specification (Chinese)
```

## Key Product Components (As Specified)

### Core Modules
1. **Natural Language Strategy Dialogue Interface** - Conversational problem definition
2. **Architecture Solution Generator** - Multi-option architecture proposals with decision matrices
3. **Sub-Agent Orchestration & Task Decomposition** - Specialized execution agents
4. **Execution Oversight & Progress Management** - Real-time progress tracking
5. **Learning & Adaptation System** - Enterprise knowledge integration

### Planned Sub-Agent Ecosystem
- Architecture Design Agent
- Technology Selection Agent
- Cloud Architecture Agent
- Code Generation Agent
- Security & Compliance Agent
- Testing Strategy Agent
- Migration Planning Agent

## Business Model
- **Individual Professional**: $299/month
- **Team Edition**: $1,999/month
- **Enterprise**: $10,000+/month
- **Revenue Streams**: Subscription, success fees, sub-agent marketplace

## Development Roadmap (As Planned)
1. **Phase 1 (0-6 months)**: Expert network launch with CTO communities
2. **Phase 2 (7-18 months)**: Vertical industry expansion (e-commerce, fintech, SaaS)
3. **Phase 3 (19-36 months)**: Platform ecosystem with sub-agent marketplace

## Target Implementation Architecture

The specification outlines a multi-layered system:
- **NLU Layer**: Intent recognition, business context extraction, constraint parsing
- **Knowledge Systems**: Architecture pattern libraries, technical decision trees, risk models
- **Multi-Agent Engine**: Task scheduling, orchestration, result aggregation
- **Output Generation**: Diagrams, documentation, code, reports

## When Development Begins

### Expected Technology Stack
- Large Language Models for natural language understanding
- Multi-agent orchestration system
- Knowledge graph databases for architecture patterns
- Web/mobile interface for conversational UI
- Integration APIs for cloud providers and enterprise systems

### Development Commands (To Be Determined)
Once implementation begins, common commands will likely include:
- Build and deployment commands
- Test execution for AI model validation
- Database setup for knowledge graphs
- API server startup
- Agent orchestration system management

### Architecture Considerations
- Microservices architecture for sub-agent system
- Event-driven communication between agents
- Scalable knowledge base management
- Multi-cloud deployment strategy
- Enterprise security and compliance requirements

## Current Next Steps
1. Technology stack finalization
2. Architecture implementation planning
3. AI model development strategy
4. Knowledge base construction
5. UI/UX development planning
6. Sub-agent system design

## Documentation Language
The primary specification document is in Chinese, targeting the Chinese enterprise market initially, though the product vision includes global expansion.
